OK, I have a new job for you, we need a data browser function added to the application, I can see two ways

1. Make the application 'tabbed' we have a query view
2. Add a new button to the right of the dataset selector and have a model popout/over

When you are planning then give me a view of which you think will work better based on the current functionality

When the function is added we first need to call this function with the dataset id: GET /api/v1/datasets/{datasetId}/data
it will return an array of:

  {
    "id": "86627c92-391a-5aca-94ce-523e3fae0d7c",
    "name": "openclaw-memory0e284085",
    "label": null,
    "createdAt": "2026-02-27T12:24:25.517907",
    "updatedAt": "2026-02-27T12:25:29.583160",
    "extension": "txt",
    "mimeType": "text/plain",
    "rawDataLocation": "file:///app/cognee/.data_storage/text_60b83b5c3cd980f2498a29ef2d74c34a.txt",
    "datasetId": "f21b6b5a-0860-5042-9fe2-5b902233581c"
  },

We then need to display a list of those with the basic info id/name/type/createdAt/updatedAt so that the user can browse.
The user can then either choose to select and display the content of that data item or cancel/back

If the user selects and item the selector can disappear and we can then display the data item contents using: GET /api/v1/datasets/{dataset_id}/data/{data_id}/raw
then display the file content. For the moment we will only handle text/plain type but make sure you stucture the code so that different types can be handled later.
When displaying text, its likely to be .md format so make sure the viewer can handle that.

Analyse the request first come back on the presentation choice and then make a plan for implementation.

------

OK, several changes.

1. When the app starts if no dataset is set in settings then the dataset selector should autmatically pop up. Once dataset is selected save the dataset name for th banner
2. If the user hasnt selected a dataset above and we have default dataset you will need to call the get datasets to match the name, if you can't find the default dataset in the list means it doesn't exist and you'll need to go back to 1 and force a select
3. Pick a new icon for settings, make it the usual cog will do
4. Make a new icon/button (graph) and if the user clicks then it should spawn a new tab => http://localhost:8000/api/v1/visualize?dataset_id=a671b215-47f5-507b-99dc-f0901ba7d5e7

Analyse and make a plan.

------

As well as the settings button we need another button linked to a popup that will allow us to select the dataset
we are working with without having to manually run the api to get all the datasets and paste in the right uuid.

This will mean we need to add a new API call to cognee:

GET /api/v1/datasets

Will return an array of json objects:

    id: Unique dataset identifier
    name: Dataset name
    created_at: When the dataset was created
    updated_at: When the dataset was last updated
    owner_id: ID of the dataset owner

I want you to get the list when the user presses the select dataset button and display each item in its own box

    <icon> Name
    <icon> id
    Created: created_at, Updated: updated_at

Make it clean/stylish. User can click anywhere on the box and it will disappear and the main config dataset id will
be set to the selected id and saved as the default for when we next start.

Analyse the code and make a plan for implementing the above and come back to me.
